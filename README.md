# Predicting Price Moves with News Sentiment

This project is part of the **10 Academy AIM Week 1 Challenge**. The goal is to assess the relationship between financial news sentiment and corresponding stock market movements using a combination of **NLP**, **time series analysis**, and **quantitative finance techniques**.


## Challenge Overview
The Week 1 challenge focuses on building a pipeline that integrates:
- Financial news headlines
- Daily stock prices
- Sentiment scoring
- Technical indicators
- Statistical correlation

Each task builds upon the previous one to form an end-to-end market signal analysis tool.


## Business Objective
The purpose of this analysis is to determine whether daily sentiment in financial news headlines can be used as a signal to predict or understand daily stock price movements. This has practical applications for:
- Building algorithmic trading strategies
- Enhancing financial forecasting models
- Automating news-based market reactions


## Dataset Overview
### News Dataset
- **Source:** Raw analyst ratings and headlines
- **File:** [`data/raw_analyst_ratings.csv`](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1rsispvTGPjC8pbKS-yYb-6dcJiXTKSAv?usp=drive_link)
- **Key Columns:**
  - `headline`: Title of the article
  - `publisher`: Source of news
  - `date`: Date of publication (UTC-4)
  - `stock`: Associated stock ticker

### Stock Dataset
- **Source:** Yahoo Finance (`yfinance` API)
- **File:** `data/extracted/combined_stocks.csv`
- **Key Columns:**
  - `Date`: Trading day
  - `Open`, `High`, `Low`, `Close`, `Volume`: Daily OHLCV data

## Task Implementation Summary

### Task 1: Environment Setup & EDA
- GitHub repo initialized with CI/CD pipeline
- `.gitignore`, `README`, and `requirements.txt` created
- Performed descriptive analysis:
  - Headline lengths
  - Most frequent publishers
  - News frequency over time

### Task 2: Technical Indicator Analysis
- Downloaded historical stock data using `yfinance`
- Computed technical indicators using `TA-Lib`:
  - MA20, MA50, RSI, MACD
- Built interactive candlestick and line charts with Plotly
- Encapsulated in `technical_analysis.py`

### Task 3: News-Sentiment Correlation
- Parsed and aligned `date` fields across datasets
- Applied sentiment scoring using `TextBlob`
- Aggregated sentiment by date
- Calculated stock returns using closing prices
- Merged datasets and computed Pearson correlation:
  > **r = 0.0013**, **p = 0.8729** (not statistically significant)


## Final Analysis: Sentiment vs Stock Return
> **Pearson correlation = 0.0013, p-value = 0.8729**

### Interpretation
- No linear relationship found between same-day sentiment and returns
- High p-value confirms lack of statistical significance
- Suggests news sentiment alone is not a reliable same-day signal


## Key Visuals and Graphs (in notebooks)
- Line plots of stock closing prices
- RSI and MACD indicators
- Scatter plot of sentiment vs daily return
- Histograms of headline lengths and GHI distribution
